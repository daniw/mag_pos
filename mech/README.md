# Mechanics
Mechanical design of the sensor housing

## Requirements
* Dimensions: The housing shall replace an existing potentiometer. 
* Material selection: All materials used in the housing should be as little ferromagnetic as possible to minimize the effect on the measurement. 
* Durability: The materials selected should prevent corrosion. 
* Protection: The electronics should be completely enclosed to prevent water or moisture to damage the electronics. 
* The Magned has the dimensions 2x2x5mm and needs to be mounted inside the shaft. 

## Design choices

### Materials
The body and shaft are made of aluminium. The exact alloy is to be defined. The PCB holder is made of plastic. the exact type of plastic is not defined yet. 

### Bearing
Igus Iglidur G bearings are used. The shaft diamdeter in the bearing is 4mm. The hole in the body has a diameter of 5.5mm. The mounting specification for the bearings specify a hole with a H7 tolerance.
